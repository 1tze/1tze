# 👋 Hello, I'm LG!

### 👨‍💻 About Me
I'm an experienced **FiveM Developer** with over **2.5 years** of experience, having contributed extensively to some of the largest servers in the Swedish gaming community. Notably, I've developed for **Unive Roleplay**, Sweden's largest FiveM server, with a community of over **400 players**. My work has had a positive impact in the community, even inspiring others—although sometimes a bit too directly, with scripts being replicated and sold on Tebex!

I'm always eager to expand my reach and collaborate with larger, global servers. I believe that my unique insights from the Swedish scene can bring something fresh to a broader audience.
